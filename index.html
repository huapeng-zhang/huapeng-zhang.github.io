                            AP Automation is a product that help company process invoices. Query invoice detail, check compliance,
                            match invoice with billing proposal, send digital data to customer.
                            As team leader, my job is design functionality with PM, plan tasks, review codes and coordinate resources.
                            Last year, we successively migrate from V1.0 to V2.0 that integrate more deeply with our base platform.
                            Optimize product, to mitigate the pressure of mysql server.

                            AP Automation has four apps that behavior very similar. It need to reuse the component as possible as we can.
                            Meanwhile, the design must be flexible as the product evolve.
                            My task is design these apps use AngularJS, implement it with several excellent inters.
                            All apps run very well for almost two years with very few bugs. It's easy to change one app,
                            and not effect the rest.
